I will be making sequels to this tutorial that build upon what we've made. If you want to be notified when they come out, there will be a form to enter your email at the bottom of the webpage.

The font is from fontmeme.com. The font did not come with a license file, but the download page said it was free for personal use.

Thanks for reading!
